    <p class>Use various equipment in order to find clues and narrow down what ghost you're facing. First of all you have 
        to find the room the ghost haunts. This can be done using either different equipment or the ghost interacting 
        with nearby objects. Once you've found the room, it's time to gather clues. Look for fingerprints, 
        low temperatures or even try to communicate with the ghost.

    <h1 style="text-align: right; margin-right: 10%;">Complete objectives</h1>
    <div class="about">
    <p>You start the game with 4 objectives. The first objective is always to figure out what ghost you're dealing 
        with. This is done by gathering 3 clues. After that, you will have 3 randomly generated objectives. These 
        can be anything from finding dirty water in a sink, witnessing paranormal activity or even taking a photo 
        of the ghost.

    <p>While you're inside the building, your sanity will be dropping. You and your teams sanity always start at 
        100%. The ghost is affected by your teams sanity, and will grow stronger the lower your sanity drops. This 
        means that managing your sanity is one if not your highest priority during the game. Some ghosts will also 
        have different effects on your sanity, making it into a possible tool for narrowing down what ghost you're 
        facing if you have a hard time finding clues. When the ghost gets stronger, it's more likely to start a hunt. 
        A hunt is when the ghost is hunting you and your team, and if they catch one of you, they're dead. During a 
        hunt, lights will start to flicker indicating that you and your team should run, hide or die.
