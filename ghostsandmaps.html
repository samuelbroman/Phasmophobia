                    Clue gathering items are as follows: EMF reader, Ghostwriting book, UV flashlight and video camera.
                    Each of these items specialise in gathering a sort of clue. The spirit box will communicate with the 
                    ghost, the EMF reader can show a lvl 5 reading, the ghostwriting book can be written in, the UV 
                    flashlight can show fingerprints and the video camera can reveal ghost orbs. The last clue (freezing 
                    temperatures) is easily found if your breath is frozen.

                    Detection items specialize in finding the ghost and what room they're haunting. The detection items 
                    are as follows: Parabolic mic, sound sensor, thermometer, motion sensor and salt. The parabolic mic 
                    can pick up sound from things such as footsteps, doors closing or opening and objects being thrown from 
                    a large distance. The sound sensor works in a similar fashion, but covers a larger area and has to be 
                    placed in order to be activated. Additionally, the sound sensor only gives feedback in the van, so you'll 
                    have to be monitoring from there in order to use it effectively. The thermometer shows the temperature in the 
                    room, and most of the time the haunting location is below 10 degrees Celsius. This can only be seen using a 
                    thermometer, with the exeption of the room being below freezing temperatures, in which case your breath will 
                    be frozen. The motion sensor works in a similar fashion to the sound sensor, only that it has a much smaller 
                    detection range and will give feedback by showing a red light. The salt can be used to put down piles of salt, 
                    in which if the ghosts walks through you can see their footsteps using a UV light source.

                    Defensive focus on keeping you and your team safe. There are currently only 2 defensive items, which makes it 
                    the smallest caterory right now. The defensive items are as follows: Crucifix and smudge sticks. 
                    The crucifix is activated once you put it on the ground, and will stop the 
                    ghost from starting a hunt within a 3 meter radius, unless you're up against a banshee, in which case the 
                    crucifix will have a 5 meter radius instead. The smudge sticks can be lit with a lighter, and if they are within 
                    6 meter of the ghost while it's active, it will stop the ghost from starting a hunt for 90 seconds. The smudge 
                    sticks have a special effect against spirits and Yureis. Against the spirit, the smudge sticks will be twice 
                    as effective and work for 180 seconds instead. The yurei will be forced to stay within the room it haunts during 
                    the duration of the smudge sticks.

                    Vision items focus on giving you light. The vision items are as follows: Candle, flashlight and strong flashlight. 
                    The candle can be lit using a lighter, and will last for 2-5 minutes. The candle is also unaffected by the ghost 
                    starting a hunt. The flashlight gives you light in a cone in front of you, and can be turned on and off. The flashlight 
                    will start flickering when the ghost starts a hunt. The strong flashlight works just like the normal flashlight, 
                    but is much stronger.

                    Miscellaneous items have a lot of different uses, but are most often used in combination with another item in order 
                    to make them more effective. The miscellaneous items are as follows: glowstick, photo camera, sanity pills, lighter 
                    and tripod. The glowstick emits a small uv light around it, and is very useful together with the salt, as you can 
                    put one next to a pile of salt which will show you footsteps as soon as they appear. The photo camera is used to 
                    complete objectives associated with taking pictures, aswell as to earn you some extra money. Taking photos will award 
                    you bonus money at the end of a mission. The sanity pills are used to restore 40% of your total sanity, making it 
                    to possible to continue the mission without being in complete danger. your sanity cannot exceed 100%. The lighter 
                    barely gives of any light, however they are used to light candles and smudge sticks. The tripod is used to mount a 
                    video camera, which can give you a better view over a room.
